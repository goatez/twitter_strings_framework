InClass Strings Activity

Names:___________________________

This is a pair programming task. Every 5 minutes switch between who is typing on the computer. Only one computer should be open with code. The second may only be used for referencing and web searches.
Sit in the chair next to your parter.

Take the strings_framework.py and the 20170405twitterdirty.txt files. 
This is real data from a database that needs to be cleaned up. FYI it has been cleaned up as seen in cleaned_twitter.txt Make sure to read through all of the instructions so you take into account all variables and information that needs to be stored.


Write a program by adding to the strings_framework.py that does the following. You may NOT modify 20170405twitterdirty.txt to clean your data. Cleaning must be done from the list created by the strings_framework.py file and your additions to that file.

1. Makes all the strings lowercase.

2. Removes any whitespace before or after the letters and numbers.

3. Remove any strings staring with #. These are either comments or headers.

4. Print out the list of any urls that include "map" or "zoo".

5. Clean up each of the strings so that they all print with the valid url 
of the twitter account. For example @wolfgang8741 would be come:
https://twitter.com/wolfgang8741 Make sure you look over your data, there are 
many types of issues to handle.

6. Run a check over your list of urls and make sure they follow the format requested. Print out "All strings are correct" if all strings start with "https://twitter.com/".

7. Print out the list in alphabetical order.

8. Print out the total number of urls that are over the length of 20 character.

9. Remove all duplicate strings. You can compare your output to cleaned_twitter.txt to see if you removed too many or too few strings.

10. Print out the number of strings removed and the list of strings removed.

11. Print out every other letter of every other string that is not a duplicate.

Whatever your status is by 10 minutes before the end of class, upload your progress on these steps
to ELMS for the participation credit for the day with your name and your partner.
